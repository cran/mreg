chop                    Internal functions for the mreg package
mreg                    To perform regression when discrete outcome
                        variables are missing
mreg-package            Implements the techniques of exact likelihood
                        when the discrete outcome can be missing in a
                        regression model.
paper                   An example of a function to calculate the
                        effect on the location that depends on previous
                        outcome in an mreg model
print.mreg              Prints the coefficients from an mreg object
radiology               A longitudinal data set
summary.mreg            Prints a summary of an mreg object
unity                   The default value of 'modify' function in
                        'mreg'
